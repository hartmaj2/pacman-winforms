# Introduction
This program is supposed to be a simplified Pacman game for my university project. I am hoping to be able to implement all the well knows features such as Pacman preemptive direction setting and some simple ghost AI.

# Input data
The map is input as a text file. To be concrete it is a character grid where each represents a different game object. The file where this map is stored is called `map.txt`
